## Overview
Customer segmentation is a critical aspect of modern retail and e-commerce. This project applies data science techniques to segment customers based on their shopping behaviors and demographic details. By using the K-Means clustering algorithm, we segment customers to help businesses better understand their target audiences for various marketing activities.

## Features
- Segmentation of mall customers based on:
  - **Age**
  - **Income**
  - **Shopping Score**
- Performed **Univariate**, **Bivariate**, and **Multivariate** analysis.
- Customer groups identified using the **K-Means algorithm**.
- Visualization of customer segments for better interpretation.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is publicly available and contains information about mall customers:
- **Features:**
  - CustomerID
  - Age
  - Annual Income
  - Spending Score (1-100)

## Analysis
1. **Univariate Analysis**: Examined each feature individually to understand its distribution.
2. **Bivariate Analysis**: Explored the relationships between pairs of features (e.g., age vs income, age vs spending score).
3. **Multivariate Analysis**: Considered all the features together to understand overall patterns and customer behaviors.

## Modeling
- **K-Means Clustering Algorithm**: K-Means was chosen for customer segmentation. After determining the optimal number of clusters using the **Elbow Method**, we applied K-Means to group the customers into distinct segments.

## Results
- Identified **N clusters** (replace with the number of clusters you found) representing distinct customer segments.
- Visualized the clusters using 2D and 3D plots to interpret the results and understand the key differences between each group.

## Technologies
- **Python**
  - Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `sklearn`
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For code implementation and data visualization.
